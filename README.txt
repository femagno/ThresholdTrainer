Threshold Trainer
Parameter Trainer
CV Trainer
Vision Trainer

The goal of this program is to capture images and use them to train a thresholding function.

Workflow:
 - Preview picture
 - Take picture
 - Highlight section or circle of interest
 - Show histogram of HSV values
 - Compare with previous values
 - Compute thresholding function

Other ideas:
 - Swipe through images w/ current threshold function
 - Specify HoughCircle parameters
 - Swipe through images w/ current HoughCircle params
